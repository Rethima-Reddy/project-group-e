# Introduction

## R language
### What is R?
- R is a programming language and environment commonly used in statistical computing, data analytics and scientific research. <br>
- It is one of the most popular languages used by statisticians, data analysts, researchers and marketers to retrieve, clean, analyze, visualize and present data.

## Keypoints on R:

## Basic syntax:
- After setting up the R environment open command promt and type the following
``` $ R
This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt > where you can start typing your program as follows −
> myString <- "Hello, World!"
> print ( myString)
[1] "Hello, World!" 
``` 
## R Script File
- Usually, you will do your programming by writing your programs in script files and then you execute those scripts at your command prompt with the help of R interpreter called Rscript. So let's start with writing following code in a text file called test.R as under −
 ``` # My first program in R Programming
myString <- "Hello, World!"

print ( myString)
``` 
- Save the above code in a file test.R and execute it at Linux command prompt as given below. Even if you are using Windows or other system, syntax will remain same.
``` $ Rscript test.R  
```
